# Web-Scrapping
I have scrapped a raw data from a website
First of all I have viewed the source page of the webpage
I have to scrap the data in four formats 
1) "Date" was enclosed in a strong tag <strong></strong> 
2) "Text" was in the form of contents in simple text
3) "Description" was enclosed in an anchor tag <a> </a>
4) "Url" was enclosed in a href 


Then I've broken the data in four different forms stored them in the list in order to made four different columns.
Finally store as a tabular data in csv format with the help of Pandas and name them "Date", "Lies", "Explanation" and "URL" accordingly. 
"Record" file has all the data in the tabular form in Csv format
